Trie.js
=======

My take on an efficient implementation of a Trie in Javascript

Short story
-----------

A Trie is a kind of digital search tree. (See [Knuth1972] for more details on digital search trees.)

[Fredkin1960] introduced the trie terminology, which is abbreviated from "Retrieval".

The trie implementation of [Dennis Byrne][2] served as a starting point and inspiration.

For more information, please take a look at the [Wikipedia article][3]

Usage
-----

Please take a look at the file

      test/test.html

which pretty much explains the things you can do with Trie.js in code.
The test.html file uses a pure JS dataset of 44.830 records, which you can find in

      data/people_44830.js

More information and full documentation of the API can be found in

      docs/index.html
      
Or read them online at https://mikedeboer.github.io/trie/.

Compiling
-----

Use `trie.js` as-is, or to compile the `trie.ts` TypeScript file into JavaScript, type into the terminal: `npx tsc trie.ts`. To compile it with *ECMAScript 6* features, add the `--target es6` flag.
